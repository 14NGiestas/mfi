## Modern Fortran interfaces to BLAS and LAPACK

This project aims to be a collection of modern fortran interfaces to commonly used procedure, for now BLAS and LAPACK.
The main goal is to reduce the pain of using such libraries, providing a generic interface to the intrinsic supported types and 
identifying the optional or reconstructible arguments of a given procedure. The code uses [fypp](https://github.com/aradi/fypp),
to generate the interfaces automatically to all supported types and kinds.

### Example $C = AB$

```fortran
program main
use mfi_blas, only: mfi_gemm
use f77_blas, only: f77_gemm
use iso_fortran_env
implicit none
! ... variables and other boilerplate code here ...
! Original interface: type and precision dependent
call cgemm('N','N', N, N, N, alpha, A, N, B, N, beta, C, N)
! Improved F77 interface: still a lot of arguments
call f77_gemm('N','N', N, N, N, alpha, A, N, B, N, beta, C, N)
! Modern fortran interface: less arguments and more readable 
call mfi_gemm(A,B,C)
end program
```

## Getting Started

### FPM

This project supports the [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm).
Follow the directions on that page to install FPM if you haven't already.

### Using as a dependency in FPM

Add a entry in the "dependencies" section of your project's fpm.toml

```toml
# fpm.toml
[ dependencies ]
mfi = { git="https://github.com/14NGiestas/mfi.git", branch="mfi-fpm" }
```

### Manual building

First get the code, by cloning the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/14NGiestas/mfi.git
cd mfi/
```

### Dependencies

Install the [fypp](https://github.com/aradi/fypp) using the command:

```sh
sudo pip install fypp
```

Install lapack and blas (use the static versions).
This can be tricky, if you run into any problem, please open an issue.

#### Arch Linux
- [aur/openblas-lapack-static](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openblas-lapack-static)

#### Ubuntu
- [lapack-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&keywords=lapack-dev&searchon=names)

Usually you can do the following:

```sh
make
fpm test
```

By default, the `lapack-dev` package (which provides the reference blas) do not provide the `i?amin` implementation (among other extensions)
in such cases you can use blas extensions with:

```sh
make FYPPFLAGS=-DMFI_EXTENSIONS
fpm test
```

Or if you have support to such extensions in your blas provider you can:

```sh
make FYPPFLAGS="-DMFI_EXTENSIONS -DMFI_LINK_EXTERNAL"
fpm test
```

which will generate the code linking extensions to the external library


## Support

Please note that this project is experimental, is missing a test suite and errors may occur (in which case open an issue). If you want a specific routine to be featured here feel free to open a PR or open an issue providing a test case, a link to an specification (docs) and it's datatype variants.

### BLAS
#### Level 1
Most of BLAS level 1 routines can be replaced by intrinsincs and other features in modern fortran.

### LAPACK :warning:

- Lapack is really huge, so I'm going to focus on getting the improved f77 interfaces ready first.
  Anything I end up using I'm going to implement.
